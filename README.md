# groot-master

It is a Java-based data visualization library designed for scientific plotting and histogram analysis. It simplifies data representation by allowing users to create 1D and 2D histograms, function plots, and error graphs. The library provides built-in fitting functions using Minuit, an optimization tool widely used in scientific computing. It includes graphical user interface (GUI) components for easy visualization, enabling researchers and analysts to adjust and manipulate plots efficiently. The project supports multiple output formats, including PDF and SVG, making it ideal for generating publication-quality plots. The library is designed to work with Java 1.8+ and integrates seamlessly into Java applications.
